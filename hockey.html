        <div class="intro">
            <p>Hockey is a fast-paced, exhilarating sport that combines speed, strategy, and physical skill. Played on an ice rink, field, or indoor court depending on the variation, the most popular form is ice hockey, especially in countries like Canada, the United States, Russia, and Sweden. Two teams of six players each—including a goaltender—compete to score goals by hitting a small rubber puck into the opposing team’s net using curved sticks. The game is divided into three 20-minute periods, and the team with the most goals at the end wins. Hockey is known for its intensity, with players skating at high speeds, executing sharp turns, and engaging in body checks to gain control of the puck.</p>

            <p>For beginners, understanding the rules is key to appreciating the game. Players must stay onside, meaning the puck must cross the opponent’s blue line before any attacking player does. Icing is another important rule: if a player shoots the puck across both the center red line and the opposing goal line without it being touched, play is stopped and a faceoff occurs in the offending team’s zone. Penalties are given for infractions like tripping, slashing, or high-sticking, resulting in the offending player spending time in the penalty box, giving the other team a power play. Faceoffs restart play after stoppages, and line changes allow teams to substitute players on the fly, keeping the game dynamic and strategic.

        <div class="conclusion">
            <p>Beyond the rules, hockey is a sport rich in teamwork and tradition. Players must communicate constantly, anticipate each other’s movements, and execute plays with precision. Goaltenders are the last line of defense, requiring lightning-fast reflexes and mental toughness. Fans are passionate, often forming deep loyalties to their teams and celebrating iconic moments like overtime goals or playoff victories. Whether you're watching a local game or the Stanley Cup Finals, hockey offers a thrilling blend of athleticism and drama. For newcomers, learning the basics opens the door to a deeper appreciation of the sport’s rhythm, rivalries, and the sheer joy of a well-played game.</p>
